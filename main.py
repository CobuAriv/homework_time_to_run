'''0. Ask the user how long it takes to walk to school in minutes
      (turn them to seconds) 
      Ask the user the speed of walking in feet per second. 
      Print to the user the estimate of distance to his or her school.
      (Put distance to school in a variable and print that variable)
      
   1. Ask the user how many days a year he or she goes to school.
      Print the time user spends on walking to school and back home
      in a year.
      
   2. **Tell the user how much time he or she will save in a year
      if he or she runs to school with a double speed of his or her walking.
      (try to make your answer in hours/days)

# help:
'''
   distance = time*speed
   time=distance//speed  (you can try distance/time division and see the difference) 
   1 minute = 60 seconds
   1 hours = 60 minutes
   1 day = 24 hours
